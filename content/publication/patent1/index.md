abstract: The invention discloses a dimensional measurement system and method based on RealSense camera, the measurement system includes a projector, RealSense camera, data processing module and measurement platform; RealSense camera and projector are set above the measurement platform by a bracket, the measured article is placed on the measurement platform, the calibration pattern projected by the projector on the measurement platform is used for the The RealSense camera captures the image of the measured item on the measurement platform and sends it to the data processing module, which then finds the minimum package size of the measured item. This invention can quickly measure the minimum package size of the item, adapt to the high-speed flow operation, and has a high measurement accuracy.         本发明公开了一种基于RealSense相机的尺寸测量系统及方法,测量系统包括投影仪、RealSense相机、数据处理模块和测量平台；RealSense相机和投影仪通过支架设置在测量平台上方,被测物品放置在测量平台上,投影仪在测量平台上投影出的标定图案,用于对RealSense相机进行位姿标定,RealSense相机采集测量平台上的被测物品图像,并发送给数据处理模块,数据处理模块求取被测物品的最小包装尺寸。本发明能够快速测量物品最小包装尺寸,适应更高速的流水作业,具有较高的测量精度。
