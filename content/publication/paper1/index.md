abstract: In view of the serious waste of package materials in domestic logistics compared with foreign logistics, and the situation of the huge requirement of packing optimization, a new type of bin packing scheme is proposed, and a packing optimization method based on Genetic Algorithm is designed. The objective is to select a package specification with minimum surface area but can accommodate a number of cuboid-shaped items from existing package specifications. In the method, genetic codes involving packing sequence and orientation, along with a space segmentation method, is used to find a packing solution. Considering the high cost of traditional laser scanning measuring equipment, a box dimension measurement method based on RGBD is proposed to adapt to the management mode of domestic storage, and to provide dimension of items for packing optimization. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective on finding package specification with minimum surface area and can measure box dimensions quickly and accurately.      针对国内物流与国外物流相比包装材料浪费严重，包装优化要求巨大的情况，提出了一种新型的仓式包装方案，并设计了一种基于遗传算法的包装优化方法。其目的是在现有的包装规格中选择一个表面积最小但能容纳一定数量长方体物品的包装规格。在该方法中，涉及包装顺序和方向的遗传代码，以及空间分割方法，被用来寻找包装方案。考虑到传统激光扫描测量设备的高成本，提出了一种基于RGBD的盒子尺寸测量方法，以适应国内仓储的管理模式，并为包装优化提供物品的尺寸。实验结果表明，所提出的方法能有效地找到表面积最小的包装规格，并能快速、准确地测量盒子的尺寸。
