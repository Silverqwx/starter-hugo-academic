Self-developed 3D camera and structured light cross-synchronous projection technology are used in this system to reconstruct living pig’s model. After completing the model reconstruction, the model is processed by steps of Denoising, alignment, registration, segmentation and measurement. At last, efficient and accurate living pig’s physical sign data is acquired.
