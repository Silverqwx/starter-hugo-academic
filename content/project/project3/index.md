Self-developed 3D camera and structured light cross-synchronous projection technology are used in this system to reconstruct living pig’s model. After completing the model reconstruction, the model is processed by steps of Denoising, alignment, registration, segmentation and measurement. At last, efficient and accurate living pig’s physical sign data is acquired.

使用自研的3D相机，基于结构光交叉同步投影技术，在0.042秒内完成全方位完整拍摄，实现活 猪实时三维建模，基于点云处理和多状态量联合估计技术，实现猪体点云数据的去噪、拼接、分 割、测量等处理，高效准确地获取活猪各项体征数据
