Three self-developed 3D cameras and structured light cross-synchronous projection technology are used in this system to achieve high-speed capturing and 3D modeling of dynamic faces. Multi-3D camera joint calibration algorithm and multi-object joint ICP fine stitching algorithm are used in this system to ensure the quality of model. 200 models are acquired per second.

使用3台自研的3D相机，基于结构光交叉同步投影技术，使用多3D相机联合标定算法、多对象联合 ICP 精拼接算法，实现动态人脸的高速捕捉与三维建模
