A camera and a projector are used to compose a projector-camera system. Gray-Phase code is used in this system to help achieve high-speed 3D reconstruction of the object surface. High-precision calibration algorithm and de-distortion algorithm are completed to ensure the accurary, and at last, accuracy of 0.01mm is achieved.
