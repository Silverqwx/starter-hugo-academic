Self-developed 3D camera is used in this system to achieve 3D modeling of 3D objects. Lie algebra and non-linear optimization algorithm is used in this system to achieve pose estimation of 3D camera and elimination of accumulated error of loopback. Computer graphics technology is used in this system to achieve visualization of 3D models and human-computer interaction.

使用单台自研的3D相机，基于图像处理和姿态估计技术，实现物体三维建模，基于李代数封闭空 间技术，实现累计误差的回环消除，基于计算机图形学技术，实现三维模型的可视化与人机交互
