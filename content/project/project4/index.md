Self-developed 3D camera is used in this system to achieve 3D modeling of 3D objects. Lie algebra and non-linear optimization algorithm is used in this system to achieve pose estimation of 3D camera and elimination of accumulated error of loopback. Computer graphics technology is used in this system to achieve visualization of 3D models and human-computer interaction.
